5.2 Facts 

- fct_worker_movement_F – transaction grain: 1 row per employee_id per effective_date (include sequence_number if needed). Derived from dim_worker_job_D (no direct L1 joins). Resolve all FKs as‑of effective_date within SCD windows. Include FKs to all dimensions , Resolve all PRIOR ROW FKs as‑of effective_date of prior row based on grain within SCD windows. Include PRIOR ROW FKs to all dimensions.  

Add the following metrics (business rules to the right): Base Pay Change Count	if current base pay - previous row <> 0 then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Company Change Count	if company id from current row <> company id on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Cost Center Change Count	if cost center id from current row <> cost center id on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Demotion Count	If Job Change = 1 and Current Grade < Previous Grade and Current Status = Active and Previous Status = Active then 1 else 0 

External Hire Count	If Business Process Reason = Hire then 1 else 0 

Grade Change Count	if grade id from current row <> grade id on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Grade Decrease Count	if grade id from current row < grade id on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Grade Increase Count	if grade id from current row > grade id on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Hire Count	External Hire Count + Internal Hire Count 

Internal Hire Count	If Business Process Reason = Change Job and Initiated from a Job Application then 1 else 0 

Involuntary Termination Count           Primary Termination Category = Involuntary 

Job Change Count	if job profile id from current row <> job profile id on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Lateral Move Count	If Job Change = 1 and Current Grade = Previous Grade and Current Status = Active and Previous Status = Active then 1 else 0 

Location Change Count	if location id from current row <> location id on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Management Level Change Count  if mgmt level from current row <> mgmt level on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Management Level Decrease Count              if mgmt level from current row < mgmt level on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Management Level Increase Count if mgmt level from current row > mgmt level on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Matrix Organization Change Count if matrix organization id from current row <> matrix organization id on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Promotion Count	If Job Change = 1 and Current Grade > Previous Grade and Current Status = Active and Previous Status = Active then 1 else 0 

Promotion Count Business Process               If Business Process Reason like "%Promotion%" then 1 else 0 

Regrettable Termination Count           

Rehire Count	If Business Process Reason = Hire > Rehire then 1 else 0 

Structured Termination Count	 

Supervisory Organization Change Count    if sup org id from current row <> sup org id on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

Termination Count	if Business Process = Termiantion Event then 1 else 0 

Unstructured Termination Count       

Voluntary Termination Count	if Primary Termination Category = Voluntary then 1 else 0 

Worker Model Change Count              if work model id from current row <> work model id on previous effdt row then 1 else 0, must be active on both rows 

 
 

- fct_worker_headcount_restat_F – monthly snapshot; restate last 24 months; one row per active (incl. leave) worker at month‑end; as‑of FK resolution.  Include all dimensions. 

Add metric: 

Headcount  if worker status = active then 1 else 0
